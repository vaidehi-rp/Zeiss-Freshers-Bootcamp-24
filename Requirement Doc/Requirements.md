# Mental Health Prediction System

**User Story:** As a mental health professional/ patient, I want a predictive system that applies machine learning algorithms to assess and predict potential mental health issues in individuals, allowing timely and personalized support.

**Functional Requirement:** System must employ machine learning algorithms to continuously learn and adapt to evolving user-generated data, including behavioral patterns, and make sure the prediction model remains up to date and relevant to the dynamic nature of mental health affecting factors.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Reliability- Predictions must have high level of accuracy and very less error rate.
- Scalability- System should handle increasing number of users and data points without compromising performance.
- Usability- System must have a user friendly and intuitive UI, catering to technical proficiency of the user.
- Privacy & Security- User data access cannot be allowed to any third-party user. A robust encryption must be implemented.
- Performance- System must deliver timely predictions and have a good response time.
